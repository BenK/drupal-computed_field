11th August 2006
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Changed display format so that you can enter arbitrary code to display the
  field

7th August 2006
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Made $node editable by computed code

3rd August 2006
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Removed a call to check_plain which was more annoying than useful.
* Changed the field to be computed on submit so that the value can be stored
  in the database. A consequence of this is that it won't work on preview, but
  at least now it is only computed once (per submit).
* Made computed fields visible in views
* Changed the value you need to set in your code from $node_field['value'] to
  $node_field[0]['value] so that multiple values can be used.

21st July 2006
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Initial Release
