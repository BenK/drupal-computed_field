------------------The Computed Field Drupal Module----------------------------

Computed Field is a cck module which lets you add a computed field to custom
content types. You can choose whether to store your computed field in the
database. You can also choose whether to display the field, and how to format
it. The value of the field is set using php code, so it can draw on anything
available to drupal, including other fields, the current user, database
tables, etc. The drawback of this is of course that you need to know some php
to use it.
